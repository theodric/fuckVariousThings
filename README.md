# fuckVariousThings
A galaxy-brain level app written in VB6 which allows you to express your displeasure on a scrolling marquee

With this amazing and innovative application, you can instruct your computer to display instructions on what you can go and fuck, be that you, your mom, your dad, your horse, or anything else of your choosing!

The code is written in Visual Basic 6 EE. If you don't feel like compiling it, you'll find a binary in /bin within this repo.


The ActiveX marquee control is AxMrquee.ocx, also provided in this repo in /AxMrquee, and  was originally released as sample code with 1997's Microsoft Visual Basic 5 Control Creation Edition.
